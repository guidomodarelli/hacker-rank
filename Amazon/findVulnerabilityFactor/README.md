The developers at Equo are working on identifying vulnerabilities in their key generation process. The key is represented by an array of n integers, where the *i*th integer is denoted by _key[i]_.
The vulnerability factor of the array (_key_) is defined as the maximum length of a subarray that has a Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) greater than 1.

You are allowed to make a maximum of _maxChange_ modifications to the array, where each modification consists of changing any one element in the array to any other value.

Given an integer array key and an integer _maxChange_, find the least possible vulnerability factor of the _key_ after making at most _maxChange_ changes.

**Note**: The length of an empty subarray is considered to be zero.

**Example**
key = [2, 2, 4, 9, 6]
maxChange = 1

The length of key, _n_ = 5. Here are some possible changes to make:

1. Change the first element to 3. The array becomes _key_ = [3, 2, 4, 9, 6]. The length of the longest subarray with a GCD greater that 1 is 2 for the subarrays [2, 4] and [9, 6].

2. Change the third element of the array to 5. The array becomes _key_ = [2, 2, 5, 9, 6]. In this case, the length of the longest subarray with a GCD greater than 1 is 2 for the subarrays [2, 2] and [9, 6].

Since no operation can reduce the maximum length of any subarray with a GCD greater than 1 to less than 2, the vulnerability factor of the _key_ is 2.

**Function Description**
Complete the function _findVulnerabilityFactor_ in the editor below.

_findVulnerabilityFactor_ has the following parameters:
  *int key[n]*: the original encryption key
  *int maxChange*: the maximum number of elements that can be changed

**Returns**
*int*: the least possible vulnerability factor of the key.

**Constraints**
- $1 <= n <= 10^5$
- $0 <= maxChange <= n$
- $1 <= key[i] <= 10^9$

## Sample Case 0

**Sample Input For Custom Testing**

```
6                    → key[] size n = 6
5                    →
10                   →
20                   → key = [5, 10, 20, 10, 15, 5]
10                   →
15                   →
5                    →
2                    → maxChange = 2
```

**Sample Output**

```
2
```

**Explanation**

Here are some possible changes to achieve the least possible vulnerability factor:

**1. First Change:**

- Modify the third element of the array to 2 and the fourth element to 3, so the updated key becomes [5, 10, 2, 3, 15, 5].

- In this case, the maximum length of a subarray with a GCD greater than 1 is 2. This applies to several subarrays:

    - [5, 10], [10, 2], [3, 15], [15, 5]


**2. Second Change:**

- Modify the first element of the array to 7 and the fourth element to 9, so the updated key becomes [7, 10, 20, 9, 15, 5].

- Here as well, the maximum length of a subarray with a GCD greater than 1 is 2, for the following subarrays:

    - [10, 20], [15, 5]


Hence, after making the changes, the least possible vulnerability factor of the key is 2.
